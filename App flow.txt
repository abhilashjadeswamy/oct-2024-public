QUESTION :🚀 At What Point is the Application Created?

When building an application using Git, Jenkins, Maven, Docker, and Kubernetes, the application is fully created at the point when a Docker image is built and deployed to Kubernetes. Let's break down the process step by step:

🛠 CI/CD Pipeline Workflow
1️⃣ Code Development (Git)
Developers write code and push it to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
This is the starting point for the pipeline.
🔹 Trigger:
Jenkins detects new code using Poll SCM or a webhook.

2️⃣ Continuous Integration (Jenkins + Maven)
Jenkins pulls the latest code from Git.
Jenkins builds the application using Maven (mvn clean package).
If the build is successful, it proceeds to the next stage.
📌 At this stage, the application is compiled and packaged but not yet created as a container.

3️⃣ Containerization (Docker)
Jenkins uses Docker to package the application into a container image.
The Docker image is then pushed to a container registry (DockerHub, AWS ECR, or GCR).
✅ At this point, the application is containerized and ready for deployment.

4️⃣ Deployment (Kubernetes)
Kubernetes pulls the Docker image from the container registry.
It deploys the containerized application in a Kubernetes Pod.
The application is exposed using a Kubernetes Service & Ingress.
✅ At this point, the application is fully created and accessible! 🎉

🔹 Final Point Where the Application is Created?
✅ When the Docker image is built and deployed in Kubernetes.
